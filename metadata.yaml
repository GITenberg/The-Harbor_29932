description: '"For Billy, an aspiring writer struggling to reconcile his sympathy
  for the workingman with his middle-class allegiance to capitalist progress, the
  New York waterfront becomes a window on the world. There he bears witness to the
  explosive tensions between labor and capital, falling under the influence of two
  divergent mentors: Dillon, an accomplished engineer and friend of the establishment;
  and Kramer, who has forsaken every comfort to live in the slums and preach the gospel
  of unionism. When the Harbor erupts in violence, Billy must choose for himself which
  path to follow."--P. [4] of cover.'
